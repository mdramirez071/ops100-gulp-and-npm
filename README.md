This is my first project for OPS100 called "Get Cats!"

The goal of this project was to accomplish the following:
-Create a local git respository
-Create a gulp build process
-Add a README.md document
-Push a branch with latest code up to Github

How to Demo this project:
1. Clone the repository locally to your computer
2. Open up the project in Visual Studio Code
3. Open up Terminal, run the command "gulp" //This will execute all of the code located in gulpfile.js and will launch the server.
4. Once the server is live, go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
5. Click the button that says "More cats right meow!", this will randomly generate a cat picture.
